### Implications of potential T-cell epitopes in human respiratory virus major surface proteins for vaccine design

**RSV T-cell epitope prediction for vaccine design:** We utilized immunoinformatic toolkits to predict T-cell epitopes in RSV major surface proteins across different strains.

**T-cell epitope diversity visulization and comparasion:** I develop a approach to get T-cell epitope profile clustering based on MDS and wrap it into a toolbox via snakemake. ([GitHub]

### Modeling the interaction of RSV and influenza cocirculation

<div style="text-align: justify">This is a infectious disease modeling study which incoperate Markov process and optimization algorithms. I aim to test whether the inhibition of co-infection happens during the infectious process ( inhibit the pathogen to enter to the cell) or caused by cross-protective immunity.</div>

### A novel nomenclature system for RSV genotyping


[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/facebook-detect-food-trends)

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build a novel nomenclature for RSV using phylogenetic approach. Then the sequences with assiged genotype were used a a trainging data to develop a software to perform automatic genotype classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and machine learning algorithms were used.</div>

###  APP: Perdict the geo-location information of SARS-CoV2 using genetic information : NLP and Naive Bayes Classifier

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://github.com/JianiC/INFO8000/blob/master/term_project/Machine_learning/CoV-country.ipynb)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/JianiC/INFO8000)

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to the isolate location of the sequences with missing information, first I vectorized RNA sequences into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using sklearn.feature_extraction.text. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to isolated country between RNA sequences. Finally, with the trained model, the sequences with missing geo information can be perdicted with an accuracy of 93%.</div>
